        <p id="about-content">
            i am a young self-learned programmer, exploring a variety of stuff, ranging from Discord bots to OS development.<br>
            my favorite language is Python, but i don't have an issue with any other languages, they are all pretty cool!<br><br>

            i also like listening, as well as making music! i use FL Studio 20 for that.<br>
            i like ham radio as well, i have an SDR and a Baofeng UV-5R!<br>
            besides that, i also like to play games! my favorites are rhythm games, but i also like open-world ones :)<br><br>
